            <h3>She is a born BatMan</h1>
            When it comes to crime-fighting in the everyday world, she’s like Batman without the cape—because who needs a cape when you have a killer sense of humor? Picture this: while Batman swoops in with his gadgets and brooding intensity, she’s sneaking snacks into the Batmobile, ready to fuel the Dark Knight with energy bars and laughter. With a wardrobe that could rival Batgirl’s—think stylish Batman tees paired with her own signature flair—she’s the fashion-forward hero Gotham never knew it needed. And while Batman has Alfred for moral support, she’s got her friends, offering sage advice and epic eye-rolls at all the cheesy superhero clichés. Let’s be real, if Gotham ever needs a quirky avenger armed with quick wit and an arsenal of cat memes, she’s the one who’ll swoop in, cape-free, to save the day—one bad pun at a time!
